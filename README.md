Product Leader: Automation & Operational Systems

I lead and build **automation-first products** that transform complex, high-friction workflows into streamlined, operator-friendly systems. My work sits at the intersection of **product strategy, systems thinking, and hands-on execution.**

I don’t just design interfaces; I build the control planes and productivity platforms that allow businesses to scale without adding linear overhead. My bias is always toward measurable outcomes: **fewer steps, zero-error rates, and faster time-to-action.**

## Product focus
- **Automation & Productivity Platforms**: Turning repetitive "drudge work" into repeatable workflows, standardized runbooks, and self-optimizing systems.
- **Control Planes & Admin UX**: Designing the "one place to run the business"—centralized management for multi-instance operations featuring global visibility, governance, and safety controls.
- **Workflow-First UX**: Reducing cognitive load for high-stakes actions. I prioritize speed and clarity by building in guardrails, auditability, and reliability-by-default.
- **Operational Excellence**: Treating reliability, observability, and scale-readiness as core product features rather than afterthoughts.

## How I Work
I bridge the gap between high-level strategy and shippable code by following a disciplined, systems-oriented process:
- **Workflow Over Features**: I start with the Job-to-be-Done, not the feature list. I define success through crisp boundaries: inputs, outputs, failure modes, and recovery paths.
- **Strategy into Artifacts**: I convert vision into high-velocity execution through detailed PRDs, phased roadmaps, and acceptance criteria that engineering teams can actually run with.
- **Safety-by-Design**: I build simple control surfaces—toggles, dashboards, and guardrails—to ensure that as we increase speed, we don't increase risk.
- **Iterative Delivery**: I ship incrementally, prioritizing based on risk, reliability, and operational cost, while ensuring every release is backed by documentation and measurable feedback loops.
